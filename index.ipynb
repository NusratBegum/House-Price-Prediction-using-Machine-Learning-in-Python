    "* **Objective**: Predict median house value (MEDV) in the Boston area from neighbourhood features.  \n",
    "* **Business context / why it matters**:  \n",
    "  - Real-estate valuation, risk assessment for mortgage lenders, investment decisions.  \n",
    "  - Insights for policy makers: how neighbourhood features affect housing value.  \n",
    "* **Key questions**:  \n",
    "  - Which features most strongly influence house value?  \n",
    "  - How accurate can our model be?  \n",
    "  - Are there biases or fairness/ethics considerations in the data?\n",
